the best-planned defense don't count for much if the people you trust to run them are ready to sell you out.

Celebrating or calling for the deaths of ohther is wrong, and bad for the soul.

Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who was killed yesterday by Israel, did so just about every time he spoke in public for 37 years.

he handed out *death to americas* and *Death to israels* the way other people would say *yo!* or *how you doin'?'* 

the one time i saw him in person, at friday prayer at tehran university in 2004, he ended his sermon with these chants and then drove off literally seconds later in the back of an armored sedan, passing so close to me that i could see his car had recently be waxed.

many, many iranians, as well as syrians, iraqis, lebanese, and ukrainians, wish khamenei could be brought back to life for just one minute, so they could give him the finger, or maybe the whole fist.


he was the enemy of many. but he was also an enemy to himself, one of the iranian regime's point of vulnerability.

during the past two years of conflict with israel and the united states, iran experienced a total failure of leadership.

it has not experienced failure in every domain.

the regime's missiles partially deterred israel.

its institutions held fast and didn't collapse.

no units of the islamic revolutionary guard corps have defected.

but the leadership--that is, khamenei and his tight circle of loyalists-- have performed shambolically.
