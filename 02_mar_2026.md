### short article
These terms refer to the same symbol (.) but are used in different contexts: a period (or full stop) ends a sentence, a point separates decimal numbers or version numbers (e.g., 3.14, version 8.1), and a dot is used for web/email addresses (e.g., example-dot-com) and general, non-textual markers. 

Key Distinctions:
Period (US) / Full Stop (UK): Ends a sentence (e.g."Stop.").
Point: Used in numbers (e.g."3.5" is "three point five").
Dot: Used for Internet addresses, URLs, and file names (e.g."google.com" is "google dot com"). 

Usage Examples:
Period: "I am at the end of the sentence."
Point: "The price is $19.99." (Nineteen point ninety-nine)
Dot: "Visit us at example.com." (Example dot com) 

In some casesdot can be used interchangeably with point for version numbers or IP addresses (e.g."Windows eight-dot-one" or "10-dot-1-dot-1").
