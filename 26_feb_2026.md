Hello, Engineer Cai,

This alarm has been frequently triggered recently, with the error code 640 indicating a timeout or connection issue, which may be caused by network instability.

Since there are only two monitoring machines for this metric and the alarm threshold is set at 50%, the alarm is being falsely triggered when network instability occurs on one of these monitoring machines.

Therefore, we would like to lower the alarm threshold for this metric to 40%. Please assist in completing this configuration. Thank you.

HTTP code 640 is not a standard, recognized IETF HTTP status code (which only range from 100-599). Instead, it is a custom or vendor-specific code, specifically identified in TIBCO Product Documentation as representing "No HTTP reply after waiting for HTTP acknowledgment wait time," indicating a timeout or connection issue.

Meaning: The server failed to send an acknowledgment within the allotted time.

Context: Typically used in specialized middleware, EDI (Electronic Data Interchange), or specific proxy servers rather than general web browsing.

Troubleshooting: Check server connectivity, network latency, or if the receiving server is overloaded.

Standard HTTP errors stop at 599 (Server Error).

#### Letter of apology
I was supposed to have an enviable job and a bright future. Through honest and hard work, I could have had a good life. 

However, all this was destroyed by my increasingly expanding desire. 

At first, I thought accepting some cashes and presents from the friends of my business circle was just a common thing and the company would not investigate it. 

However, it was just this mindset that made my greediness heavier and heavier. It evolved from gaining petty advantages to accepting bribes of a huge amount of money. 

My deeds have brought irredeemable losses to my company, my family, and myself. It's too late to say regrettable.
