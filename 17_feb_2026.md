"Thinking about" means actively contemplating, reflecting on, or considering something, often for an extended period. It involves deeper processing, such as evaluating a decision ("thinking about a new job") or focusing on a specific subject. It is distinct from "think of," which often implies a quick, passing memory or an idea that pops into mind. 
Key Aspects of "Thinking About"
Active Contemplation: Mentally reviewing or analyzing a subject.
Duration: Suggests a period of reflection rather than a fleeting thought.
Decision Making: Used when weighing pros and cons.
Context:
Decision Making: "I'm thinking about moving to a new city".
Mental Focus: "I was thinking about what you said".
Reminiscing: "I was thinking about our last vacation". 
"Thinking About" vs. "Thinking Of"
Think About: Deep, sustained, or critical thought.
Think Of: Often means remembering, briefly considering, or a sudden realization. However, in many contexts, especially future plans ("thinking of/about going"), they are interchangeable. 
Common Uses
Considering: "She is thinking about her future".
Planning: "We're thinking about a trip".
Mental Processing: "He needs time to think about the offer".
